# AWS-Healthcare-Project
AWS Healthcare Project: Patient Admission Prediction and Analytics Platform
Objective:
To predict patient admissions in the next quarter based on historical healthcare data. This will allow healthcare organizations to optimize staffing, resource allocation, and budgeting.

Components:

Data Collection and Storage:

Data will be collected from publicly available healthcare datasets, potentially from sources like the CDC or Medicare.
This data will be stored in Amazon S3 as raw, unprocessed data.
Data Processing:

Batch Processing:
Using AWS Glue, create an ETL job to process and transform the raw data into a structured format.
Store the processed data in Amazon Redshift for fast analytics.
Real-time Processing:
Simulate a real-time data stream of patient check-ins using Lambda functions to generate and send data to a Kinesis stream.
Process the data stream using EMR with Spark and store the processed stream in DynamoDB for real-time analytics.
Predictive Analytics:

Using Amazon Sagemaker with Jupyter Notebooks, analyze the processed data to derive patterns.
Implement a predictive model using historical data to predict patient admissions.
Visualization:

Use QuickSight to create dashboards and visualizations.
Showcase patient trends, admission rates, and predictive results.
APIs:

Use Amazon API Gateway and Lambda to expose an endpoint where real-time predictions can be made.
This would be especially useful for integrating with other systems in a healthcare facility.
Budget Optimization:

Showcase how AWS Cost Explorer and budget reports can be used to monitor and optimize costs, especially focusing on the usage of reserved instances vs. on-demand, and potential savings plans.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement CloudWatch for monitoring the performance and health of the entire architecture.
Use CloudTrail for auditing and tracking user activity.
Languages/Tools: PySpark, SQL, Java for Lambda functions.
